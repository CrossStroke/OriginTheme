# Origin Theme
A starter theme, specifically for one-off bespoke themes.

More specifically, this is _my_ starter theme. It is how I start all my personal and client projects. It might not be your cup of tea, and that's just fine ðŸ™‚ The Fork button is close by.

It is geared towards one-off themes where customisation options are something the client doesn't need or, isn't something they should even have access to. It also removes comments, as i'm yet to build a client site with them.
